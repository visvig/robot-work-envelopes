# work-envelops
A work envelope, or robot's workspace, is the spatial region a robot can reach with its end-effector. Understanding a robot's work envelope is vital for design, assessing capabilities, and determining suitability for specific tasks. Work envelopes differ among robot configurations, each with unique shapes and ranges of motion for specific applications.

This repo contains MATLAB codes and work envelope plots for

1. Cartesian Robot
The Cartesian robot, also known as a linear or gantry robot, employs three linear actuators along the X, Y, and Z axes to achieve motion. This configuration is characterized by its rectangular work envelope, with sides parallel to the X, Y, and Z axes. Cartesian robots are often used for tasks that require precise linear movements, such as pick-and-place operations or 3D printing.
2. Cylindrical Robot
The cylindrical robot utilizes a rotary actuator for rotation about a vertical axis and a linear actuator for motion along the vertical axis. It operates within a cylindrical work envelope with a circular base and a height defined by the linear actuator's range. Cylindrical robots are commonly used in assembly lines, material handling, and packaging applications.
3. Spherical Robot
The spherical robot employs three rotary actuators to achieve motion, creating a spherical work envelope defined by the range of motion of these actuators. Spherical robots, also known as polar robots, can access points within a ball-shaped volume in three-dimensional space. These robots are often used for tasks that require a wide range of motion, such as welding or painting.
4. SCARA Robot
The SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot features two rotary joints for motion in the X-Y plane and a linear joint for motion along the Z-axis. The work envelope of a SCARA robot is crescent-shaped, defined by the range of motion of its rotary and linear joints. SCARA robots excel in high-speed, high-precision assembly and pick-and-place operations.
5. Articulated Robot
The articulated robot uses multiple rotary joints to achieve motion, resulting in a complex work envelope defined by the range of motion of its joints. The envelope varies depending on the number of joints and their arrangement. Articulated robots, also known as serial manipulators, are highly versatile and can be found in applications ranging from automotive assembly to medical surgeries.
